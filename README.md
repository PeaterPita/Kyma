# simplex-noise-visualiser
A tool to visualise simplex noise in a command-line interface.

This is a seriously simple project, and merely came to fruition so I could learn simplex, rich, and shell scripting. Do not expect any future updates.

## Installation

This branch uses `uv` to automatically prepare a virtual environment and dependencies.

Run the following command at the project root:

```
uv run src/main.py
```

If you do not have `uv` installed, you can do so via the following method:

    <summary>Windows Installation</summary>

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm [https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1](https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1) | iex"
```

<details>
    <summary>Linux / Mac</summary>

```sh
curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh
```

I'm actually unsure whether this works on mac or linux lol - I'll have to check it at some point :)
